# Salary Prediction Model Using Telco Customer Data

## Project Overview

In this project, a salary prediction model was developed using the WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn dataset, which contains information about customer behavior, demographic details, and service usage. The goal was to predict salaries based on customer data using machine learning algorithms.

## Approach

Two algorithms were employed for the salary prediction task:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**

Both models were trained and tested on the dataset to determine which algorithm provided the best results.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated how customer data in the telecommunications sector can be used for salary prediction. The findings show that **Linear Regression** is a more suitable model for this task compared to Logistic Regression.
